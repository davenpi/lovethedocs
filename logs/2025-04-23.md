### What I changed

1. Simplified schema.
2. Hacked the code patcher to work (get indentation from scope which feels brittle).
3. Improved the system prompt.

### Why it matters

1. Make model response simpler.
2. We can now run the full pipeline and get properly formatted responses.
3. Makes output better and more reliable (though quality still varies with minor prompt
   tweaks).

### Measurements

- Test coverage 39%

### Open questions

- How do we keep line length formatting on nested objects? For example, I tell the
  model to give me 88 chars max, but on Class.method.inner that might run over the 88
  char limit. Prompting does inform about qualname and implores the model to account
  for leading spaces. Let's see. We don't need to be perfect on that. I can just
  review and edit.
- How to not waste tokens on docs that are already good? Right now I'm
  having the model just echo them back. That's token inefficient and error prone.

### Next actions (tomorrow)

- Make diffs easier to look at and incorporate.
- More tests. Get to 95%
- Run on `lovethedocs`
