### What I changed

1. Changed test structure
2. Chunk prompt by module
3. Update schema
4. Pass the model qualnames
5. Implement an AST patcher (broken)

### Why it matters

1. Tests way clearer and mimic package structure
2. Save tokens and save on model context. Can parallelize calls in future.
3. Schema is simplified now that we only use one module at a time. Hopefully easier
   on the model.
4. With qualnames the model should hallucinate function and modules a lot less. This
   also allows for more robust evaluation of model outputs in the future. I'll be able to
   explicitly verify that all the qualnames are there and that none are hallucinated.
5. AST patcher is what is actually responsible for updating the signatures and
   docstrings. Right now it formats the docstrings incorrectly, but we'll fix that.

### Measurements

- Test coverage: 37%

### Open questions

- How can I prompt the model to respond better? Still need to do some formatting hacks
  inside the structured response (e.g., tell it not to put docstrings in triple quotes)
- How do I build the AST patcher correctly? Need to get the formatting.

### Next actions (tomorrow)

- Get the AST parser working right. Do it cleanly without regex and hardcoding based
  on hints of what the model response looks like.
- Run `lovethedocs` on the whole codebase
- Figure out how to reduce latency even more
- Get test coverage up to 95%.
- Write an eval.
