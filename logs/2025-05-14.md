### What I changed

### Why it matters

### Measurements

### Open questions
- What evals make sense?
- How to make this more useful on large, well documented repos?
- What about a `lovethedocs check` command, give feedback on what will be updated, and
then only update specific functions.
- Improve both user documentation and developer documentation. Now we only do code
docs.

### Next actions (tomorrow)
