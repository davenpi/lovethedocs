### What I changed

1. Add interactive diff review
2. Major refactor of domain

### Why it matters

1. More pleasant to use
2. Easier to understand what's going on. More modular.

### Measurements

- Test coverage down. Now at 65%.

### Open questions

- It seems the suggested docs are different. What's going on? Test heavily.

### Next actions (tomorrow)

- Test the domain
