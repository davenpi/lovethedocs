## YYYY‑MM‑DD

### What I changed

- Bullet list (code, schema, infra)

### Why it matters

- One sentence per bullet

### Measurements

### Open questions

- Can we add a bug catcher without distracting the LLM from its core duty? That would
  be very helpful. Basically code review as well as documentation cleaning.
- Don't want failure on a single file to stop the entire run. How can we give progress
  updates and a summary of what happened?

### Next actions (tomorrow)
