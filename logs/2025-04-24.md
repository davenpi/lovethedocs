## YYYY‑MM‑DD

### What I changed

1. Fixed bug in file system.
2. Test code patcher.
3. Big refactor of directory structure.
4. Add ports/dependency injection.
5. Increase test coverage.

### Why it matters

1. Wasn't catching absolute paths.
2. More confident that code patcher works.
3. Naming should be more clear now and indicate functionality.
4. Allows me to access different providers/filesystems and have a better conceptual
   view of what is needed to make the code work. Should make it easier for newcomers
   too.
5. A lot more confidence in the code.

### Measurements

- 98% test coverage of src/

### Open questions

- Can we add a bug catcher without distracting the LLM from its core duty? That would
  be very helpful. Basically code review as well as documentation cleaning.
- Don't want failure on a single file to stop the entire run. How can we give progress
  updates and a summary of what happened?

### Next actions (tomorrow)
