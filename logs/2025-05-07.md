### What I changed

1. Fix patcher to work on stubs
2. Refactor run pipeline into package.
3. Add tests for new package.

### Why it matters

1. Less crashes!
2. Simpler and handles run time errors gracefully.
3. Safety.

### Measurements
- 69% test coverage.

### Open questions
- Style handling is messy. How to fix?
- Add evals. What makes sense?
- Make tests way better.

### Next actions (tomorrow)
- Much more testing.
- Evals.
