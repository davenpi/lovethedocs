### What I changed

- Separating concerns out into `infra`, `domain`, `application`, and `cli` sub-packages.

`infra` is responsible for I/O. It talks to the external model API and it writes/reads
from disk.

`domain` is responsible for defining key parts of the model (not used yet) and handling
the output from the model (adapter which puts model response in the form we want). This
takes a response we got from `infra`, parses it to some new form, and then `infra` is
used on the parsed output to write to disk.

`application` imports both `infra` and `domain` and runs the whole pipeline.

`cli` is the entrypoint for the package and just puts it all together. Run
`python -m src.cli.lovethedocs path/to/my_modules` to get edits at
`my_modules/_improved`

- Structured output

### Why it matters

- More robust design. Can think about each part of the code distinctly and not have
  huge modules doing several unrelated things.
- Structured output means less wrangling with the model in the system prompt. It should
  cut down on output tokens. It also removes a bunch of fragile output parsing code.

### Measurements

- Prompt tokens: 478
- Call latency: 8s (average over three runs). Way too long

## Open questions

- How do we go from the current structured output to meaningful diffs? Only writing
  the docstring edits to a file now.
- Why is latency so high with API calls? How can we make that much smaller?

## Next actions

- Per file prompt (need to figure out latency issue for sure)
- Loop over prompts
- Implement syntax tree code patch
- Hit at least 95% test coverage
