### What I changed

1. Made `DocStyle` usage consistent.
2. Moved domain ports to their own module.
3. Abstracted diff reviewer.
4. Fixed file system.

### Why it matters

1. Now there is one kind of `style-like` parameter. Simplifies usage.
2. Cleaner code.
3. Not stuck with VS Code only.
4. No file system headaches.

### Measurements

### Open questions

- Style is opaque in `ModuleEditGenerator` constructor. What's a good fix?

### Next actions (tomorrow)

- Fix broken tests.
- Abstract formatter (don't force `black`).
- Update usage using `typer`
